                If you’ve never hired a personal trainer before, you may be
                unsure as to what exactly their responsibilities would be.
                Essentially, a personal training professional is someone who
                strives to help clients achieve their fitness goals, which may
                include everything from weight loss and strength training to
                general health management.

                Your first personal training session is an opportunity to get to
                know your trainer and decide if they are the right fit for you.
                Additionally, your personal trainer will use this chance to
                perform a number of initial fitness assessments that will help
                you track your progress as well as discuss your needs and
                long-term goals with you.

                Although the first part of your session will mostly focus on
                talking and paperwork, your Los Angeles personal trainer will
                probably make you sweat a bit in the second half. They’ll most
                likely have you do some basic exercises such as lunges, squats
                or kettlebell swings, just to assess your current fitness level
                and tailor your workout routine accordingly. They’ll also ask
                you about any injuries you might have had, or other medical
                conditions.
